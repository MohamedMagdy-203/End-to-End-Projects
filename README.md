# End-to-End Machine Learning Projects 🚀

This repository is a collection of my end-to-end machine learning projects, covering the complete workflow from raw data to model evaluation.  
Each project is organized in its own folder with Jupyter notebooks and code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
